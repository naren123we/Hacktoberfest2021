=======================================================

An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. 
This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the
first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

Array is a container which can hold a fix number of items and these items should be of the same type. 
Most of the data structures make use of arrays to implement their algorithms. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Array.

Element − Each item stored in an array is called an element.

Index − Each location of an element in an array has a numerical index, which is used to identify the element

Array Representation:-
Arrays can be declared in various ways in different languages. For illustration, let's take C array declaration.

      int array[5]={23,45,67,56,34};
     
     In this array:-
      array[0]=23
      array[1]=45
      array[2]=67
      array[3]=56
      array[4]=34
      
     
As per the above illustration, following are the important points to be considered--

*Index starts with 0.
*Array length is 5 which means it can store 5 elements.
*Each element can be accessed via its index. For example, we can fetch an element at index 45 as 1.


 Apart from this,there are many functions in the array data structre which we can use.
